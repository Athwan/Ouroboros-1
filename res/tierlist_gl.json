With the advent of the last 4 units I stated in the last 2 months, \nhe’s no longer the King he once was. If JP gets an F/SN rerun, this might change, but there’s no guarantee\n of that. His base stats are just sad, and the “lightning nuker” niche is becoming saturated. But is he worth \nthunder sharding for now? Yes, it’ll be a long time before we see Nigel and co.\n\nFate Yomi lacks damage which is her main issue. However, she never gets “replaced” like \nGilgamesh is, since her kit is so unique. At any rate, putting wind shards into her is a good idea.\n\nI do not suggest dumping all your rainbow shards into either however. There are so many more \ngood units who will come eventually, some sooner and some later. Don’t \nthrow all your eggs into one basket.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNote from me: This mostly applies to the F2P to Dolphin crowd (basically everyone who only gets shards\nfrom EX maps and Gumi giveaways). While this still does apply to whales, this is the most efficient list for\nthose who want to get the most out of their Rainbow/Elemental Shards. The most important thing to\nremember is to play for your enjoyment right now. The future of this game, and this game in JP should not\naffect what you do, if it affects your experience right now.",

Although multiple units may have\nthe improvement for the same job, they will improve different skills and use different equipment,\nfarmable at different events. For example, Rahu and Lofia both have Chronomancer+, but Rahu's\nChronomancer+ improves her Overclock, while Lofia's improves her Black Hole. Rahu gets much more\nAGI, and her Job+ Equipment can only be farmed during the Toy Box event, while Lofia has more MATK,\nand her equipment can only be farmed during the Sweet Aspirations event.\n\nJE, or Job Enchantments are not yet released on Global. There are a number of JEs for a job (so Holy\nCavalier will has Holy Cavalier[Pieta], Holy Cavalier[Izaya], and more). These job enchantments are\ndistributed to a group of characters who have that job, and are not made specifically for any character.\n\nJ+ require 6 special equipment at Job Level 11, while JE requires only the job-special equipment\nwhich is a special varient found on JE maps that are permanent. E.G: Holy Cavalier[Pieta] uses\nPieta Armor instead of the Brilliant Wings Armor.",

    "Aswald Detailed Breakdown": [
        [
            "Aswald\nUnit Detail:\nJob 1: Shadow Assassin\nJob 2: Twin-Blade Swordsman\nJob 3: Gunner\n\nLeader Skill:\nDark - 40% PATK | 5% Evasion\n\nBefore talking about Aswald and her pros and cons, it’s important to first understand the Assassin job, and what it brings.\n\nAssassin is a 4 move, 4 jump, high agility DPS. It specializes in various forms of ranged CC, as well as high damage, defense ignoring backstabs. What assassin lacks is strong ranged damage and survivability, having somewhat low HP with little defensive options.\n\nMain Job: Assassin\nThe primary choices for her main job are between Assassin and Twin-Blade Swordsman. Gunner, while useful for the ability to Pinpoint Shot for the stop status effect is not a reliable choice otherwise. There are a few things to compare when talking about Assassin and Twin-Blade Swordsman. Both have their strength being high AGI DPS that have inconsistent defensive options. Twin-Blade Swordsman has more passive evasion with Feint and Perfect Evasion, while Assassin has evasion in Air Surge on their main skillset.\n\nIn terms of damage options, Assassin has most significantly Soul Slicer which is a 200% modifier (250% to humans) attack that ignores defense if used with a backstab. It also increases her AGI by 80% for one turn. Air Surge is a 5x5 125% modifier diamond AoE around herself that increases evasion by 50% for one turn.\n\nTwin-Blade Swordsman in comparison has their most significant ability in Bladestorm, a 4 range straight line single target ranged attack, and has a 3x3 110% modifier cross around herself as their AoE option in Spinslash.\n\nComparing these two, it’s evident that Assassin has higher damage potential. Although its costs are higher and has no range, Assassin has two defense ignoring attacks, and can increase their own AGI significantly, which can help them get more turns than Twin-Blade Swordsman.\n\nThe last thing of note between these two jobs is their mobility. Assassin has 4 move and 4 jump, while Twin-Blade Swordsman only has 3 move and 2 jump. Aswald’s Assassin also has higher AGI than her Twin-Blade Swordsman. Both jobs being of the high AGI squishy DPS types, Assassin has a much more reliable way of surviving, with buff options on her main skills which are of much more significance than Twin-Blade Swordsman and their damage-only main skillset.\n\nBasic Ability: Basic Assassination\nThe competition for basic ability is not nearly as debatable as main job. Basic Assassin gives three range dagger throws that inflict various CC: Poison, Blind, Paralysis, Sleep, and Charm. \n\nBasic Twin-Blade Swordsman gives a “blind” on a low damage one range skill, self buffs for evasion and PATK (insignificant buff), and a 100% modifier evasion skill with high cost.\n\nBasic Gunner shouldn’t be considered even on ranged units.\n\nReactive: Perfect Evasion\nAssassin’s reactive Stance of the Runner gives a 50% chance to increase their own CT by 40 when hit (4/10 of the CT required for a turn). At first it seems like a good reactive for Assassin, who is somewhat of a tempo-focused job. The flaws behind this though are that Assassin is already fairly squishy. This reactive is counter-intuitive in the way Assassin wants to be played, with their AoE skill on their main skillset giving high evasion chance. The reactive does not proc if they are not hit, but if they are hit, their evasion efforts are wasted.\n\nAs a result, Perfect Evasion, which gives a 10% chance to evade physical attacks is a much better choice for their playstyle. \n\nPassive 1: Stealth\nEach job of of Aswald has one passive, meaning she has 2 of 3 choices to select. Stealth gives her Move +1 and Jump +1, which is a very reliable passive that helps with the style that Assassin wants to be played of maneuvering to key targets with a high damage defense ignoring attack, then running out of range from retaliation. \n\nPassive 2: Range +1 or Feint\nThe second passive is the interchangable. Feint increases her evasion, which helps with survivability, but is very RNG-based. Range +1 increase the range that she can throw her CC daggers, and can be very significant in reaching important enemies, but may not always be necessary. \n"
